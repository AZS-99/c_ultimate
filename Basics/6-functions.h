/*
Write a program to display all prime numbers within a range. For instance:
Prime numbers between 25 and 50 are:
29
31
37
41
43
47
*/



/*
Write a function that prompts the user to enter an integer, then prints all factors of that integer:

Sample:
Enter an integer: 8
Output:

/*
In mathematics, the Fibonacci numbers are the numbers in the following integer sequence, called the Fibonacci sequence,
and characterized by the fact that every number after the first two is the sum of the two preceding ones.
Depending on the chosen starting point of the sequence (0 or 1) the sequence would look like this:
1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, …
or this:
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, …

We'll pick the first version.

Write a function that accepts an integer n, and returns the nth fibonacci value.

Sample Input 1:
4
Output for sample input 1:
3

Sample Input 2:
10
Output for Sample Input 2:
55

Problem Description
In a sumac sequence, t1, t2, ..., tm, each term is an integer greater than or equal 0. Also, each term, starting with the
third, is the difference of the preceding two terms (that is, tn+2 = tn − tn+1 for pens_count ≥ 1). The sequence
terminates at tm if tm−1 < tm.
For example, if we have 120 and 71, then the sumac sequence generated is as follows:
                                        120, 71, 49, 22, 27.
This is a sumac sequence of length 5.

Input Specification
The input will be two positive numbers t1 and t2, with 0 < t2 < t1 < 10000.

Output Specification
The output will be the length of the sumac sequence given by the starting numbers t1 and t2.

Sample Input 1
120
71
Output for Sample Input 1
5

Sample Input 2
4180
2585
Output for Sample Input 2
10

Problem: Is Palindrome
Write a function that takes a string as an arguments, and returns true if it is a palindrome, false otherwise.

Sample Input 1:
MAMA
Output for Sample Input 1:
False

ABBA
Output for Sample Input 2:
True
