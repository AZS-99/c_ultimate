/*
Write a program that prompts the user to enter a point (x, y) and checks whether the point is within the circle
centered at (0, 0) with radius 10. For example, (4, 5) is inside the circle and (9, 9) is outside the circle

(a) Points inside and outside the circle
(b) points inside and outside the rectangle

Sample Input:
Enter a point with two coordinates: 4, 5
Output for Sample input:
Point (4.0, 5.0) is in the circle

Sample Input 2:
Enter a point with two coordinates: 9, 9
Output for Sample input2:
Point (9.0, 9.0) is not in the circle

Write a program that prompts the user to enter a point (x, y) and checks whether the point is within the rectangle
centered at (0, 0) with width 10 and height 5. For example, (2, 2) is inside the rectangle and (6, 4) is outside the
rectangle, as shown. Here are two sample runs:


Sample Input:
Enter a point with two coordinates: 2, 2
Point (2.0, 2.0) is in the rectangle

Enter a point with two coordinates: 6, 4
Point (6.0, 4.0) is not in the rectangle
