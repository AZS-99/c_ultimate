Most digital devices show numbers using a seven segment display. The seven segments are arranged as shown:
  * * *
*       *
*       *
*       *
  * * *
*       *
*       *
*       *
  * * *

For this problem each segment is represented by three asterisks in a line as shown above. Any digit from 0 - 9 can be
shown by illuminating the appropriate segments. For example the digit 1 may be displayed using the two segments on the
right side:
        *
        *
        *

        *
        *
        *

The digit 4 needs four segments to display it properly:
*       *
*       *
*       *
  * * *
        *
        *
        *

Sample Session (User input in italics)
Enter a digit between 0 and 9: 9
  * * *
*       *
*       *
*       *
  * * *
        *
        *
        *
  * * *
