A simile is a combination of an adjective and noun that produces a phrase such as "Easy as pie" or "Cold as ice".
Write a program to input n adjectives (1 < n <= 5) and m nouns (1 < m <= 5) provided by your contest supervisor,
and print out all possible similes. The first two lines of input will provide the values of n and m, in that order
followed, one per line, by n adjectives and m nouns. Your program may output the similes in any order.

Sample Input:

Smart
Soft
pie
rock

Sample output:
Easy as pie
Easy as rock
Smart as pie
