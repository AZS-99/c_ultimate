Problem J4: Anagram Checker
Problem Description
An anagram is a word or a phrase formed by rearranging the letters of another phrase such as “ITEM” and “TIME”. Anagrams
may be several words long such as “CS AT WATERLOO” and “COOL AS WET ART”. Note that two phrases may be anagrams of each
other even if each phrase has a different number of words (as in the previous example). Write a program to determine if
two phrases are anagrams of each other.

Input Specifications
The program should prompt the user for two phrases, each entered on a separate line. You may assume that the input only
contains upper case letters and spaces.
Output Specifications
The program will print out one of two statements: ”Is an anagram.” or ”Is not an anagram.”

Sample Prompting and User Input (user input in italics)
CS AT WATERLOO
COOL AS WET ART
Output for Sample Input
Is an anagram.

Sample Input 2
HAPPY DAYS
PAD AS SAPPY
Output for Sample Input 2
Is not an anagram.
